Image to Caption to Speech converter. I have used GRU RNN with Attention Mechanism to extract the features from the image and return the decoded text, and Google Text-to-Speech API to get the final converted speech. I used [the Flickr8k dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k) for model training and evaluation.
